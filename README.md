My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.

### Intro

I am retired seafarer who coded for a hobby. The first program I wrote was for a university project where we created a celestial navigation calculator using Excel. At that point I got hooked, started reading programming and trying things out with Python (only the basics). When the pandemic hit, I found myself stuck at home with nothing much to do. That's when I decided I might have a go at the programming career.

Ever since then I've been self-teaching using any free resource material I could find off the internet. FreeCodeCamp, Javascript.io, Frontend Mentor, anything free I would happily take on, haha. At first it was a struggle, cause there was a whole lot of new things. Eventually thought I found things started to become natural. There are still a lot of things I don't know, but I've always believed that working on things you find hard or difficult will always be worthwhile in the end.
